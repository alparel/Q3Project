				</th>
				<td>
					<p style="text-align: center;">The time it takes for a fire to start is really short. Get someone to watch the food for you if you have to leave the kitchen for any reason at all, or simply turn everything off until you return.</p>

				</th>
				<td>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Your home's heating sources may very possibly start a house fire if they aren't operating properly. Always change the filters in your air conditioner, keep your heaters away from anything that could catch fire, and have a professional inspect these things once a year.</p>

				</th>
				<td>
					<p style="text-align: center;">If exposed to a significant source of heat, household cleansers and products like hair spray or shaving cream may become quite dangerous. Always keep these safely locked up and away from heaters in a cool location.</p>

					<br>
					<p class="text-center" style="font-size: 14px;">Maintain your wires</p>
				</th>
				<td>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Try to be considerate and check the wire for damage or chewing before plugging something into a socket (in case you have any pets running around). Broken wires should be replaced as soon as possible because they can provide a risk for a fire. Moreover, keep in mind that when in use, wires can get hot, so pay attention to where you lay them and avoid passing them through carpets or other potentially flammable materials.</p>

				</th>
				<td>
					<p style="text-align: center;">We agree that lighting candles throughout the house to create a romantic ambiance is excellent. You may even consider lighting the fireplace to make your home feel more cozier on a chilly winter night. We won't advise you to completely stop using candles and fireplaces, but we will advise you to exercise caution. Turn off all of your candles before dozing off, and if you have pets, try to keep the open flames as far away from them as you can.</p>

				<th><img src="Extinguisher.webp" class="rounded mx-auto d-block" height="100px" width="150px">
					<br>
					<p class="text-center" style="font-size: 14px;">Have a blanket or fire extinguisher nearby at all times.</p>
				</th>
				<td>
					<p style="text-align: center;">Fire extinguishers and blankets will be your best defence in the case of a fire breaking out. To ensure that anything that does catch fire in your home can be extinguished as quickly as possible, everyone in the family should be familiar with how to use a fire extinguisher. Fire blankets are also excellent for extinguishing little fires before they get larger and more furious.</p>
